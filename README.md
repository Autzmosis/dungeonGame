#Yet to be named dungeon game

##**By EncodedPixel**

###GUI has been updated to kivy, if you would like to test it out you must do the below things:
* download repository
* install python2 https://www.python.org/downloads/
* install kivy http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation.html
* run main.py from terminal or command prompt

####Visit the dropbox folder, for videos the current GUI: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/px7he1pssd3fv48/AAABccXOwlWEoe4dJcRMsF93a?dl=0

The purpose of this project is simply to make an expandable dungeon game using python. It will be
made into an app later. For the basic story line, there will be about ten different dungeons. 

Since this is a text adventure we will need to make methods that recognize typed words, like
'look' or 'walk'. Bare minimum features are listed below:

Player starts in a dream and learns about their world as they progress (Kinda of like Dark Souls, way of storytelling)
Upgrade points will be used to up stats

* Text recognition
* 3 Character classes (Rogue, Warrior, Mage)
* 3 Different enemies per dungeon
* Helper Characters
* pet that grows up with character
* Multipule Bosses
* 10 Dungeons
* Storyline
* Sprites and backgrounds

####Special Abilities for the character classes are as follows:
* Rogue - Dual Blitz: Hits target twice with regular attack.
* Warrior - Beserk: Increased damage and lower defense at a low health.
* Mage - Drain: Siphon SP on physical attack.

###Basic attributes for character classes:
<table border=3px>
<tr>
<td>   </td><td> <b>Rogue</b>  </td><td> <b>Warrior</b>  </td><td> <b>Mage</b>  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Hp  </td><td> med   </td><td> high   </td><td> low   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Sp  </td><td> med   </td><td> low   </td><td> high   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Atk  </td><td> low   </td><td> high   </td><td> low   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Def  </td><td> low   </td><td> high   </td><td> med   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Ma  </td><td> med   </td><td> low   </td><td> high   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Md  </td><td> med   </td><td> low   </td><td> high   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Lck  </td><td> high   </td><td> low   </td><td> med   </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td> Spe  </td><td> high   </td><td> low   </td><td> med   </td>
</tr>
</table>

The 'high', 'med', and 'low' provided in the table are basic stats, they will be replaced
by numbers later.

####Abbreviations are defined as follows:
* Hp - Health
* Sp - Spill Points
* Atk - Attack
* Def - Defence
* Ma - Magical attack
* Md - Magical defence
* Lck - Luck
* Spe - Speed

##Deadline for this project varries.
