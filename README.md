The purpose of this project is simply to make an expandable text adventure game using python. It might be
made into an app later. For the basic story line, there will be about ten different stories wrapped in a
epic quest for several Artifacts. 

Since this is a text adventure we will need to make methods that recognize typed words, like
'look' or 'walk'.

######Basic
* Text recognition
* Player learns about their world as they progress
* Multiple Character classes
* Enemies will be combinations of Species and Classes
* Occasional NPC companion
* Multiple Bosses
* Sprites and backgrounds
