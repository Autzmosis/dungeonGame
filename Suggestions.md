- [x] We should have pets that grow along side the player, but also have temporary NPC teammates that help the player in quests or battles.
- [x] Both of these will not be controlled by the player but will act in coordination with the player
- [x] If you want see an example of a pet growing with the player, see dragonboy: http://armorgames.com/play/4893/dragon-boy

- For the main menu where the player chooses which of the three, place the stats but instead of abbreviation place icons. 
- For example:
- HP would be a heart or a cross
- Attk would be a sword or a hatchet
- Def would be a Viking shield or English shield...focus on the shape not the imagery.
- and so on...

- General Lore: There were once many dieties that ruled over Heaven, Hell, and Earth. One day, one of the dieties kills all other dieties in order to become "the one True God." In the process of doing so, Heaven is closed off from the humans and the Gates of Hell are open to Earth. This has made Earth a sort of purgatory, all that who die are reincarnated as humans (and/or demons?) and the land is overrun by foul demons. Many brave individuals have tried to kill the "one True God" in hopes of returning the universe to normal, but to avail. The player is one such individual. 
- Upon choosing class and name, the player is thrust into a story-relevant tutorial. There is an individual that mocks the player and implies that they already know who the player is. The individual is amused and trains the user on certain basic functions, like general UI and battle. After doing so, the individual comments on whether the user will be able to fix everything. The player then wakes up in the middle of a field and the actual game begins.
- The player will be told almost nothing about the story outright. The player will gain knowledge of the in-universe lore through interactions with Non-Playable Characters (NPCs) and item decriptions.
- There may be multiple endings, including one "true ending" that may/may not require multiple playthroughs.
- In the class select, there will be a sprite of what the class "looks like" and a brief description of the class's stats, through flavour text and not outright telling the user the stats. (Ex: A warrior. A class that fights head-on with honor and bravery, using their high attacking prowess and defensive capabilities to defeat their foes)
- In order to create many unique moves for each class and not overwhelm the user with choice, I was thinking this: Every class will have a small number of moves (2-3) that they will always have. There will be multiple weapon types for each class, and when these different weapon types are equipped, they will grant the user additional moves specific to that weapon type. 
  - Example(not actual concept): Warrior may have a "Two-handed Sword" weapon type and "Short Sword and Shield" weapon type. The         "Two-handed sword" weapon type may grant the user the moves "Heavy Swing" and "Great Thrust" that have high power and low accuracy,   and the "Short Sword and Shield" weapon type may grant the user the moves "Parry" and "Shield Bash" which have lower power, but       better secondary effects or general use. So, if the user has equipped a weapon that is a "two-handed sword," they would have the 2-3   moves all warriors start with, and "heavy swing" and "great thrust" from their weapon.
- The mage may be able to summon demons that utilize a certain element(should we decide upon a system of elemental magic RPS), or buff the user, inflict neutral physical/magic damage, et cetera.
