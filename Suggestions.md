- We should have pets that grow along side the player, but also have temporary NPC teammates that help the player in quests or battles
- Both of these will not be controlled by the player but will act in coordination with the player
- If you want see an example of a pet growing with the player, see dragonboy: http://armorgames.com/play/4893/dragon-boy

-For the main menu where the player chooses which of the three, place the stats but instead of abbreviation place icons. 
For example:
-HP would be a heart or a cross
-Attk would be a sword or a hatchet
-Def would be a Viking shield or English shield...focus on the shape not the imagery.
-and so on...
